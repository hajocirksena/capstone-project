# this is my stuff

„this is my stuff!“ is a digital lost-and-found office.
The user registers his favorite items and generates an individual QR code. This code then gets placed on the item.
If an item is lost, the finder can use the QR code to contact the owner of a found item and return the "stuff".

## Special Thanks

This app was created as a capstone-project at [neuefische](www.neuefische.de) webdevelopment bootcamp in Hamburg. Without the coaches and of course my classmates in w2 2020 this wouldn't have been possible. Thank you!
